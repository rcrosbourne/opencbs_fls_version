# OpenCBS

#### Adaptive open-source technology for microfinance.

OpenCBS is an open-source loan tracking software for microfinance institutions.

The main features are:

- Client management
- Loan management
- Savings management
- Collateral management
- Loan schedule generation
- Loan portfolio tracking
- Custom fields
- Standard reports
- Custom reports
- Plugins

and more.

OpenCBS is a fork of the last open-source version of Octopus Microfinance Suite, which started in 2006.


The mid- and long-term vision is to convert the program into a platform through a service-oriented architecture. It means minimizing the core, improving the extensibility framework, and making it frictionless for third-party developers to build upon.

Here is a list of big themes that we want implemented in the coming year:

- [API](https://github.com/PavelBastov/opencbs/issues/10)
- [WPF](https://github.com/PavelBastov/opencbs/isuses/11)
- [Localization](https://github.com/PavelBastov/opencbs/issues/13)
- [Specflow](https://github.com/PavelBastov/opencbs/issues/18)
- [MS Office](https://github.com/PavelBastov/opencbs/issues/5)
